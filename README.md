# Coding Problems in Python

This repository contains my personal collection of solved algorithm and data structure problems in Python. It serves as my practice log and learning journal for improving problem-solving skills, mastering common patterns, and preparing for technical interviews.

The solutions cover a range of topics including linked lists, strings, arrays, sliding windows, integer operations, and more. Alongside the code, I often add comments and explanations to clarify my thought process.

This repo reflects my ongoing progress and experimentation with different approaches, optimization techniques, and coding styles.
